BRIEF ABOUT HAPPINESS.CSV DATASET:-
    1.This dataset paints a broad picture of well-being across the globe, measured through a variety of indicators over nearly two decades, from 2005 to 2023. 
    2.At its core, it shows the **Life Ladder** (a measure of life satisfaction), which on average is around 5.48, with some regions scoring as high as 8.02, and others as low as 1.28. This indicates that while some countries experience high life satisfaction, others face considerable challenges.
    3.Economically, the **Log GDP per Capita** is another key factor, averaging 9.40. The range of this metric spans from 5.53 to 11.68, revealing significant differences in wealth across nations. However, even in wealthier countries, the **Social Support** score is moderate, with an average of 0.81, showing that while many people feel supported, there's still room for improvement in fostering stronger social connections.
    4.In terms of health, **Healthy Life Expectancy** at birth averages 63.4 years, with a wide range between 6.72 and 74.6 years, reflecting disparities in healthcare access and quality. Alongside health, the **Freedom to Make Life Choices** score is relatively high, averaging 0.75, indicating that most people globally enjoy a fair amount of autonomy in their lives.
    5.Interestingly, **Generosity** has a near-zero average (0.00), pointing to little variation in the willingness to donate or help others across regions. Similarly, **Perceptions of Corruption** have an average score of 0.74, indicating that corruption is commonly perceived but varies significantly between nations.
    6.Finally, the dataset captures **Positive Affect** and **Negative Affect**. On average, people report a moderate level of positive emotions (0.74) and lower levels of negative emotions (0.27), showing a general trend of well-being but with regional variation.
    7.Together, these metrics provide a snapshot of global well-being, revealing that while many regions show positive trends in life satisfaction and freedom, disparities in health, wealth, and social support remain significant.

BRIEF ABOUT THE CLEANING OF DATA:-
    1.This dataset, spanning 2363 records from 2005 to 2023, provides a snapshot of global well-being, but it’s not without its imperfections.
    2.A small percentage of the data has missing values—particularly in **Generosity** (3.43%) and **Perceptions of Corruption** (5.29%), which could indicate gaps in regional reporting or inconsistent data collection.
    3.Other factors like **Log GDP per capita** and **Healthy Life Expectancy** also have missing values, though to a lesser extent.
    4.Interestingly, there are no duplicate rows or invalid year entries, meaning the dataset is largely reliable in terms of its temporal integrity. 
    5.However, a total of **266 rows** have been flagged for review, possibly due to inconsistencies or discrepancies that warrant closer attention.
    6.Despite these gaps, the dataset still offers valuable insights into life satisfaction, economic conditions, health, and perceptions of freedom across countries.
    7.While most indicators show moderate averages—such as life satisfaction (5.48) and health expectancy (63.4 years)—the missing data highlights areas where further research or more consistent reporting could provide a clearer, more comprehensive view of global well-being.
